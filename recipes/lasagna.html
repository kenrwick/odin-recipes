        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the meat sauce.</li>
                <p>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</p>
                <p>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water.
                    Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper.
                    Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
                </p>
                <li>Cook the noodles.</li>
                <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
                    Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes.
                    Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.
                </p>
            <li>Make the ricotta mixture.</li>
                <p>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</p>
            <li>Layer the lasagna according to the recipe instructions.</li>
           <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <p>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
                    Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly.
                    Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture.
                    Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices.
                    Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan Cheese.
                    </p>
                    <p>Repeate layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</p>
            <li>Cover with foil and bake</li>
                    <p> To prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure foil does not touch the cheese.</p>
                    <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.</p>
                    <p>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes</p>
                    <li>Let the lasagna rest 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
