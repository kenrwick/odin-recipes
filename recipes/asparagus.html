        <strong>How to Trim Asparagus</strong><br>
        The quickest and easiest way to trim your asparagus is to line up all the (clean) stalks on a cutting board, then use a
        sharp chef’s knife to cut off the thick ends. That’s all there is to it! If you’re worried about cutting at the wrong
        place, here’s a tip from recipe creator swedishmilk: “To remove woody ends, grab a stalk of asparagus at either end and
        bend until it snaps. It will naturally snap where it starts to get tough.”
